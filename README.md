# dcss-puppet-init
Just a bunch of spaghetti code designed for personal use. Includes customization, flavor, and stuff for roleplaying in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Like anyone cares, lol.

Installation:
Just drop this stuff in your "settings" folder wherever your DCSS is installed. Probably could be used for 'online' games, too, but I never tried online DCSS for serious.
Open your macro.txt and add line:

init.txt is optional, you can ignore it if you want. To make script work properly add last line in your own init.txt:

include = puppet.lua

M:[

A:===menu

([ can be changed to any key you want)

Misc Info:
I've been working on this stuff for years now. I have a personal passion for this game since I was looking for a Dwarf Fortress replacement that is able to play on portable devices. I was searching for copper and found gold. My imagination made a huge variety of pictures that were constantly flowing through my mind. It also kinda helped me in hard times. A lot of games and fiction had inspired me to make this compilation of scripts, including Oblivion, Daggerfall, Diablo II, Torchlight, Dark Souls and many other truly magnificent games. The best part is by using ingame inscriptions and notes you can make out any scenario. I've never seen anything like this before. It is so painful to me to witness how DCSS devs are cutting stuff in half, though.

Well, probably it isn't much interesting to you, and the last thing I want to say is
thank you Michael Barlow (michaelbarlow7) for introducing me to this beautiful game.
